What do young women look for when shopping in the summer vs. older men? How do their flavor preferences and brand expectations differ?
Is there a campaign we could create to target both? This would be for Texas Pete.
I like this idea: Pop-up "Spice Stations" at Texas summer festivals, offering samples with QR codes linking to recipes. Where would be the optimal place to hold this?
Can you analyze which Texas festivals have the best foot traffic by age group?
Suggest brand collaborations with Texas food trucks or hot sauce influencers.
Create a plan for the Texas Pete team to execute this.
Draft a one-pager for sponsors or event organizers to pitch our Spice Station.
