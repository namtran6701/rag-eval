I'm launching a premium skincare line targeting anti-aging. What consumer segments should I focus on?
Can you find specific data on the purchasing power and beauty spending habits of affluent women aged 45-65? 
Based on that data, how should I position against established brands like Est√©e Lauder and La Mer? 
Create a brand messaging framework that addresses the specific concerns you identified earlier. 
Now adapt that messaging for a limited budget launch - what would you prioritize?
